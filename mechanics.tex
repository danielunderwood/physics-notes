\part{Mechanics}


Material from this chapter mainly comes from NCSU's PY411 and PY412 classical
mechanics courses. In addition to the provided material, the course covered perturbation
theory and nonlinear dynamics/chaos; I hope to instead contain these in notes on math
and special topics, respectively.

Note that this section does not take relativistic effects into consideration, so definitions
such as those of momentum and energy may differ from the relativistic definitions.

\chapter{Fundamental Principles}

We begin with the basic fundamental principles of physics. These largely begin with
Newton's laws and apply to a single particle.

\section{Newton's Laws}


Newton's laws are where the basic principles of physics begin. They are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item An object in motion will stay in motion
\item Force produces an acceleration proportional to mass
\item Each action has an equal and opposite reaction
\end{enumerate}

It is important to realize that Newton's laws require an inertial reference frame, that is,
a frame that is moving with constant velocity without any acceleration. Velocity and
acceleration with respect to what? Space itself -- Newton's concept of space was absolute.

The first law, also referred to as the Law of Inertia, states that in the absence of forces,
a particle will continue moving at a constant velocity.

The second law, often described in the mathematical form of \cref{eqn: newton-second},
is one of the core equations used in physics. In a sense, it defines mass as a quantity
that resists acceleration; this is the concept of inertial mass.

\begin{align} \label{eqn: newton-second}
\vec{F} &= \dot{\vec{p}}  && \\
&= m \vec{a} &&\text{(In the case of constant mass $m$)}
\end{align}

The third law, called the principle of action and reaction, is sometimes given in the
mathematical form of \cref{eqn: newton-third}. It is important to realize that this
law does not necessarily hold for systems \cite{goldstein_cm}.

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: newton-third}
\vec{F}_{ij} = -\vec{F}_{ji}
\end{equation}

In addition to the form of the law presented in \cref{eqn: newton-third}, which is known
as the weak law of action and reaction, the strong law of action and reaction exists. The
strong law requires that the forces in a system are equal and lie along the line joining
two particles; this is mathematically expressed by \cref{eqn: strong-action-reaction}.

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: strong-action-reaction}
\vec{r}_{ij} \times \vec{F}_{ji} = 0
\end{equation}

\section{Momentum}

Momentum is largely defined by \cref{eqn: newton-second}; momentum is the quantity
that changes as a force is applied. It is mathematically defined by \cref{eqn: momentum}.

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: momentum}
\vec{p} = m \vec{v}
\end{equation}

\section{Energy}

A quantity of large important in mechanics is the kinetic energy $T$, defined by
\cref{eqn: kinetic-energy}. Kinetic energy is acquired by applying a force.

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: kinetic-energy}
T = \frac{m v^2}{2}
\end{equation}

Another type of energy, often described as potential energy $U$ can be quite confusing.
The potential energy is associated with the forces present that are trying to change the
momentum of the particle. A similar concept is the work, defined by \cref{eqn: work},
which is the change in the energy of a particle as it moved from position $\vec{r}_1$ to
position $\vec{r}_2$ by a path $\gamma$.


\begin{equation} \label{eqn: work}
\Delta E = W = \int_{\gamma} \vec{F} \cdot \vec{dr}
\end{equation}

Potential energy can be defined in terms of \cref{eqn: work} when the force is
conservative ($\nabla \times \vec{F} = 0$) by $U = -W$. Note that in this case
(and for any line integral of a conservative vector), $\vec{F}$ being conservative makes
the integral in \cref{eqn: work} depend only on the end positions $\vec{r}_1$ and
$\vec{r}_2$ and is independent of the path $\gamma$.

\section{Conservation of Linear Momentum}
In a system of $n$ particles and using Newton's second law, we have
\begin{align*}
\vec{F}_{ij} + \vec{F}_i^{\rm{ext}} = \dot{\vec{p}}_i && i = 1, ..., n
\end{align*}

Adding the $n$ equations together, we obtain

\begin{equation*}
\sum_{i \neq j} \vec{F}_{ij} + \sum_i \vec{F}_i^{\rm{ext}} = \sum_i \dot{\vec{p}}_i
\end{equation*}

In the case that the strong law of action and reaction applies, we can use
\cref{eqn: newton-third} and the first summation cancels, leaving

\begin{align*}
\sum_i \vec{F}^{\rm{ext}}_i &= \sum_i \frac{d}{dt} \vec{p}_i \\
&= \frac{d}{dt} \sum_i \vec{p}_i
\end{align*}

In the case that there are no external forces on the system, we get

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \sum_i \vec{p}_i = 0 \implies \sum_i \vec{p}_i = \rm{const}
$$

or, the momentum of the system is conserved. Note that this is not general and depends
on the weak law of action and reaction being satisfied and there being no external forces
on the particles (or the external forces somehow canceling among the particles).

\section{Block on Inclined Plane/Ramp with Friction}

We consider a block of mass $m$ on an inclined plane with static friction with magnitude
f and ``flatworld'' gravity  given by $\vec{F}  = -mg\unit{y}$. The plane makes an angle
$\theta$ with the ground; this setup is seen below:

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[help lines, color=gray!30, dashed] (0,0) grid (4.9,4.9);
\draw[->,ultra thick] (0,0)--(5,0) node[right]{$x$};
\draw[->,ultra thick] (0,0)--(0,5) node[above]{$y$};
\draw[blue, thick] (0,0) -- (4,4);
\draw (1, 0) arc (0:45:1) node[xshift=10pt, anchor=north west]{$\theta$};
\draw [red, rotate=45, shift={(1, -1)}] (1,1) rectangle (2,2);
\draw[->] (1.4, 2.1) -- (1.4, 1.1) node[anchor=west]{$F_g$};
\draw[->] (1.4, 2.1) -- (2.1, 2.8) node[anchor=south]{$F_f$};
\draw[->] (1.4, 2.1) -- (0.7, 2.8) node[above]{$F_N$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\label{fig: block-ramp}
\end{figure}

We let the static friction force be $\vec{F}_f = f \unit{t}$ where $f$ is the magnitude
of the force of friction and $\unit{t}$ is the direction tangent to the plane, which is
$\unit{t} = \cos \theta \unit{x} + \sin \theta \unit{y}$.

The normal force is $\vec{F}_N = N \unit{n}$ where $\unit{n} = - \sin \theta \unit{x} +
\cos \theta \unit{y}$ is the vector normal to the plane. The normal force resists whatever
is pushing down on the block, so we have $N = mg$. We can now apply Newton's second
law:

\begin{align*}
m \ddot{\vec{r}} &= \sum \vec{F} \\
&= \vec{F}_g + \vec{F}_N + \vec{F}_f \\
&= -mg\unit{y} + mg \left(- \sin \theta \unit{x} + \cos \theta \unit{y} \right) + f \left(
\cos \theta \unit{x} + \sin \theta \unit{y} \right) \\
&= \left( f \cos \theta - mg \sin \theta \right) \unit{x} + \left( f \sin \theta + mg \cos
\theta - mg \right) \unit{y}
\end{align*}

This leads to equations for x and y:

\begin{align*}
&\ddot{x} = \frac{f}{m} \cos \theta - g \sin \theta \\
&\ddot{y} = \frac{f}{m} \sin \theta + g \cos \theta - g
\end{align*}

Provided that $f$, $m$, $\theta$, and $g$ are taken to not depend on time or position,
each of these equations may be integrated to find

\begin{align*}
& x = \left( \frac{f}{m} \cos \theta - g \sin \theta \right) \frac{t^2}{2} + v_{0,x} t
+ x_0 \\
& y = \left( \frac{f}{m} \sin \theta + g \left[ 1 - \cos \theta \right] \right) \frac{t^2}{2}
+ v_{0,y} t + y_0
\end{align*}

where the initial conditions are $v_{0,x} = \dot{x}(0)$, $x_0 = x(0)$, $v_{0,y} =
\dot{y}(0)$, and $y_0 = y(0)$.

\textbf{Extension:} How does this solution change if we take one of the constants to not be constant, but
dependent on either position or time?
