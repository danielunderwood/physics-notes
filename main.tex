These are my notes from my college physics courses. I am recording these to review my
knowledge and identify where any misunderstandings are; I plan to correct those
misunderstandings during the writing of these notes. Many of the notes are reorganized
and slightly changed compared to the actual courses. I will try to give references where
possible. Please let me know if there are any remaining misunderstandings or errors.

Each chapter will be a topic that is hopefully largely self-contained. The chapters will
consist of notes on various topics, followed by appendices that will contain principal
formulas, derivations, and examples.
